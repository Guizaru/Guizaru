**`Aspiring Software Artisan (Student/Developer/Game Enthusiast)`**

I'm a Brazilian computer science student at UFABC, passionate about building software and exploring game development. I'm currently focused on object-oriented programming with Java, honing my skills through personal projects and academic work. As I grow as a developer, I’m preparing to dive into powerful frameworks like Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate to bring more structure, scalability, and depth to my future applications.

Every project I build is a step forward — from writing clean, efficient code to solving real-world problems through logic and creativity :) .

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Guilherme's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my coding journey as a curious computer science student at UFABC, eager to explore every corner of this vast world — from writing my first lines of Java, to diving into the fundamentals of algorithms, systems, and software design. Early on, I felt drawn to game development, fascinated by the idea of creating interactive experiences from scratch. But as I grew more confident with object-oriented programming, I became deeply focused on mastering Java and preparing myself for the world of professional software development. That focus has shaped my current path: learning robust frameworks like Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate — tools I believe will empower me to build scalable, meaningful applications. Still, there’s always been a bigger dream sitting quietly in the background: to bring a complete product to life. Something I can call mine from end to end. Right now, I’m laying the foundation. Every project, every Git commit, every lesson learned brings me one step closer. I’m not rushing — I’m building with intention. Because when the time comes, I want to be ready not just to code, but to create something lasting.
